          <hr className="m-2 dashed" />
          <p className="text-secondary pb-3">
            There is no one standard approach to build a report that is concise
            and detailed. For a company that deals with numerous industry
            verticals, relying on one approach isn't often futile. We believe
            that the process of developing business intelligence for each market
            has to be fresh and unique as the trends, drivers, restraints,
            regional aspects, and competition dynamics are unique for each
            market. This brings us to follow a research methodology that is
            based on current standard protocols, past experience, and, more
            importantly, from a mixture of expert advice and profound data
            analysis.

          <p className="text-secondary pb-3">
            Once you place an order for a product listed on our website, payment
            for that product becomes due and owing immediately. Notwithstanding
            the fact that the product will not be dispatched until monies are
            received in full, you are liable to pay to Value Market Research all
            monies due on foot of the order. Once we receive your order, we will
            arrange the shipping. Because of this element of work involved, we
            regret that it is not possible for an order to be cancelled once it
            is submitted. Value Market Research will not be responsible for any
            delay or failure to comply with our obligations under our contract
            with you where such delay or failure arises from any cause which is

            However, the exact delivery schedule may vary for each product and

            the purchase process or completion of the same. Hardcopy products
            are generally dispatched from the EU or the US, and delivery to some

            electronically.
